    '''	Analyzing the written work of someone is very difficult because of the complexities of human language. There are many varieties in words that must be accounted for, and many different ways to do so. In general, there are several common models used for simplifying language enough that a computer can analyze it, including context free grammars, markov chains, and treating language as a simple "bag of words" with no order. Many words in language are much more common than others, and some of these common words have inherently no meaning at all, but are simply used to connect other words and show a relationship between them. It is hard to pick a model or framework that works best as there are so many and not all entirely accurate. Juola came up with a method for combining the methods to get the best of all of them. This framework includes canonicization, determination of the event set, and statistical interference.
    Once the necessary data is obtained, there are many different ways to analyze it and determine the author. The methods of analysis fall into two categories: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised methods require no previous information and simply explore the given data. Supervised methods, however, use prior data such as sample documents to compare to the current data. This can often times be more accurate but requires prior data. Within the unsupervised category, the methods for authorship analysis are vector spaces and pca, multidimensional scaling, and cluster analysis. Within the supervised category, the methods include simple statistics, linear discriminant analysis, distance-based methods, general machine learning techniques, and support vector machines. When selecting which method to choose, one must consider the information available and the desired final result. Some are more accurate but not friendly to the user, while others may have slightly more error but be much easier to read or identify the result.
